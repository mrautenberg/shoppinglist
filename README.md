# Listig - the smart todo-list

A simple todo-list application where items can be added, changed and removed.
The list is the first individual project of the front-end development education @ KYH.
The code is based upon tutorials and snippets which have been slightly modified with the purpose to learn how to read/modify code in this early stage of the education.

## Code sources

A huge thanks to Brad Traversy and Dev Ed for their great tutorials that have been the the reference for the Todo funcionality(DevEd - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ttf3CEsEwMQ), the navbar (DevEd - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXkqy0b4M5g), the contact form and validation (Brad Traversy https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/) 

## Functionality that remains to be added

Adding items by speech and photo will be added later when learning more about API's
