# Listig - the smart todo-list

A simple todo-list application where items can be added, changed and removed.
The list is the first individual project of the front-end development education @ KYH.
The code is based upon tutorials and snippets which have been slightly modified with the purpose to learn how to read/modify code in this early stage of the education.

## Code sources

A huge thanks to Brad Traversy and Dev Ed for their great tutorials that have been the the reference for the Todo funcionality(DevEd - ), the navbar (DevEd - ), the contact form and validation (Brad Traversy) and the avoid animation when resizing (CSS tips).

## Functionality that remains to be added

Adding items by speech and photo will be added later when learning more about API's
